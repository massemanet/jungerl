This is an embryo to a Javascript support library for Erlang
and Yaws programming. The inspiration for this library is the
impressive "Ruby on Rails" system and its support for Javascript,
which are using the "Prototype" Javascript library.


To test it do:

1. Modify the ./priv/yaws.conf file
   Change the docroot path accordingly

2. Start Yaws as:

     yaws -i -c ./priv/yaws.conf -pa ./ebin

   and browse: 

     http://localhost:4080/

   or

     http://localhost:4080/tabtastic.yaws

also checkout the stock_chart ticker in priv/docroot
