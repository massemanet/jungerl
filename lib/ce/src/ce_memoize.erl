%% @doc Memoization (cacheing) design pattern.
%%
%% <p>When functions are executed using <code>ce_memoize:apply/4</code>,
%% their results are saved for future reference (subsequent calls to
%% <code>apply/4</code>) in an ets table.  This can be useful for values
%% which are slow to initially calculate and rarely change thereafter,
%% and where speed is desired for every access.</p>
