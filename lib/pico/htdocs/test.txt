The AXD 301 is a new, general-purpose, high-performance ATM switch
from Ericsson that can be used in several positions in a network.
In its initial release, the AXD 301 is scaleable from 10 Gbit/s—in one
subrack—up to 160 Gbit/s. The AXD 301 supports every service category
defined for ATM, including ABR. An advanced buffering mechanism allows
services to be mixed without compromising quality.
