This is an implementation of AgentX (RFC2741) for the OTP snmp agent.

Configuration
-------------
Add to snmp_ext.conf

  %% To start as a master
  {agentx, master}.               %% behave as an AgentX master
  {agentxListenIp, {A,B,C,D}}.    %% default is {127,0,0,1}
  {agentxListenPort, int()}.      %% default is 705
  {agentxTimeout, int()}.         %% default is 15000 (ms)

  %% To start as a agent
  {agentx, agent}.                %% behave as an AgentX agent
  {agentxMasterIp, {A,B,C,D}}.    %% default is {127,0,0,1}
  {agentxMasterPort, int()}.      %% default is 705
  {agentxTimeout, int()}.         %% default is 15000 (ms)


TODO
----
An agent could be implemented as a specific snmp_net_if process, I
think.  The MPD and VAC would be dummies.  This should be easy.
Registration and index allocation etc should be done a function calls.
