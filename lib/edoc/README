		EDoc 0.1
		--------

(See edoc.html for the full documentation.)

EDoc lets you write the documentation of an Erlang program as comments
in the source code, using Javadoc-style tags and XHTML markup.

This program is still in the early beta stages, but is already quite
usable. Some parts of the syntax for certain tags may be subject to
changes, but most of the current interface and syntax can be regarded as
stable. For example, the whole of the syntax_tools package (v. 1.2) has
been documented using EDoc, as well as of course EDoc itself.

EDoc requires syntax_tools 1.2 and xmerl 0.17, or later versions; these
can be downloaded from www.erlang.org.

Ideas and help are welcome; the time I have available for hacking on
EDoc is rather limited, so don't expect me to implement your favourite
ideas while you are waiting - you are welcome to do it yourselves.
However, I don't want features to be added in a too ad-hoc way - this
should be a great tool that can be used by every Erlang programmer, and
features that don't work well will get thrown out without any mercy on
the poor sods that are already using them.

A prototype style sheet "stylesheet.css" for EDoc-generated HTML files
is included in the distribution. This is also open for improvements.

Enjoy!
