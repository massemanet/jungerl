{abstract,"This is an Erlang-X11 binding, now converted to use"
	"the binary syntax. Yes, that's right, a binding ! Not another 
	"interface to a toolkit. This is the X11 "
	"protocol implemented solely in Erlang. The release version "
	"indicates how much of the protocol that has been implemented "
	"so far (i.e Ver: 0.1 == 10%). However, this package also "
	"consists of a complete framework for the protocol implementation, "
	"so the rest of the protocol would be very easy to implement."
	"(I estimate that the remaining 90% of the protocol could be "
	"implemented in 2-3 weeks). A 'cool' example program comes along "
	"with the package. <b>NB: ex11 is the new name and replaces "
	"the old name x11</b>."}.
