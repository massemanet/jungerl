ex11-0.11B
==========

The 0.11 version was converted to use the binary
features of Erlang and work is under way to 
implement more of the protocol. The project was
also included in JungErl at SourceForge.

*** Thu Mar 11 1999 ***
ex11-0-11.tgz
===========

The package has changed name from x11 to ex11
to avoid any confusion. Also, a few changes
has been done so that it now should be possible
to run on Windows (assuming you have an X server).

*** Tue Feb 23 1999 ***
x11-0-1.tgz
===========

This is an Erlang-X11 binding, i.e an implementation
of the X11 protocol in Erlang. At the time of this
writing about 10 % of all requests/events has been
implemented. The rest of the protocol would probably
only take 2-3 weeks to implement since a complete 
framework exists already. Anyone interested in helping
out with this should read README.developers. But before
anything more are implemented I suggest that we wait
for the new Erlang bit-syntax to be released.

-------------------------------------

To compile, run: 

  make

Check out the code in rcube.erl for an example on how 
to use ex11. Run: 

  rcube:start(), %% default host is "localhost"
  rcube:start(HostName),

where HostName is the name of the machine where your
X-server is running (e.g rcube:start("campari").
