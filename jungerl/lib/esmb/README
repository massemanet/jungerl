	
This is an implementation of a subset of the SMB protocol.

The file esmb.erl exports a number of functions that makes
it possible to perform file operations towards a Windows
(or Samba) server.
	
The file esmb_client.erl is an example of how to use these
funtions to build an application. In this case it mimics
the smbclient program that comes along with the Samba
distribution.

If you want to add functionality it may be useful to
know how I have been working. First of all, there exist
a document describing CIFS 1.0 (i.e the SMB protocol).
It has been cruicial for my work but not enough. I have
been making heavy use of ethereal comparing this 
implementation with smbclient as well as with Windows
machines. Some obsolete SMB commands, not found in
the CIFS document can be found at www.thursby.com.
Finally, NetBIOS is described in RFC 1001,1002.

To see what protocols messages that are sent when using
the smbclient program. Try the following commands:

  smbclient //korp/tobbe -U tobbe
  smbclient korp -L -U tobbe
