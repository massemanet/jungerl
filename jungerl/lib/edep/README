edep install
------------

Add a symbolic link to edep/scripts/edep from for example /usr/local/bin
updated the JERLHOME to point to the jungerl home location. (fixme)

The edep script needs a modern version of getopt and will probably not
work on MaxOSX 1.2.x (maybe 1.3?) (fixme)

compiler options supported
--------------------------

  -W     ignored
  -v     ignored
  -I     used for -include
  -o     used for target path in dependency rule
  -D     ignored
  -b     ignored
  -pa    used with include_lib
  -pz    used with include_lib
  -MM    skip dependency rules to OTP libraries
  +term  I think it works ???

Usage
-----

Typical usage in a makefile:

all:	$(OBJS)

depend:
	edep -MM -o ../ebin $(ERLC_FLAGS) $(SOURCES) > depend.mk

clean:
	rm -rf $(OBJS) depend.mk

-include depend.mk
