This little program is very much inspired by Expect.
See: http://expect.nist.gov/ for Expects home page.

Erlspect is a simple tool for automating interactive text 
based applications like telnet etc. And also for testing 
such applications.

Erlspect spawns a port with a command. The user can then interact
with the started program and match on expected outcome(s).

Check the testprograms two examples 
test_erlspect:ls_beam().
test_erlspect:telnet_http().

The match expression is using Erlangs regexp library with its 
deviations from ordinary regular expressions, so check out
this in case you think your regular expression should match but
fails to do so.

Known problems:
Can't interact with ftp sessions for some reason.
