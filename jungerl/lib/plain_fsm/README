Note for Jungerl users.

The edoc parts of plain_fsm were written to take advantage of 
the latest edoc, and the makefile does so as well. Until the 
new edoc is available in Jungerl, the edoc files cannot be rebuilt
properly.

You can either download Richard Carlsson's beta version (0.4) of edoc
at http://user.it.uu.se/~richardc/edoc/ and rebuild doc/plain_fsm.html
manually, or leave it as is for now.
