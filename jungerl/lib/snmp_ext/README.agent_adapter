General
-------
  Acts as a subagent towards the snmp master agent, and as a SNMP
  v1/v2c manager towards the real SNMP agent.  This setup is useful
  when you want to have a master-subagent relation, but the agent
  doesn't support SMUX or AgentX.  The foreign SNMP agent must be
  configured to send traps to this process.  There is one process per
  agent connection.

  NOTE: Two-phase SET cannot be implemented!  This means that in the
  worst case, we'll have to send a undoFailed.  In the normal case,
  where the subagent implements a whole MIB tree, each SET request to
  the master agent will contain either no or all varbinds to this
  subagent.


TODO
----
  o  handle timeouts (and retransmits ?)
  o  test!
