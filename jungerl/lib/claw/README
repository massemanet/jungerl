CLAW is an embryonic compiler from Core Erlang to Common Lisp. Core
Erlang is an intermediate language between Erlang and e.g. BEAM. It is
simple, quite close to Lisp, and is used internally by the standard
Erlang compiler. You can compile from Erlang to Core Erlang with

  erlc +dcore foo.erl

which generates "foo.core".

CLAW is just for fun. It is currently only-just complete enough to
compile and run a factorial program, written by hand in a Lispy syntax
but using only Core Erlang constructs.

The overall strategy is to write a compiler as much as possible by
simple macro-transformation from Core Erlang to Lisp.

To run the factorial program, just go into the source directory, start
a fresh Common Lisp (e.g. CLISP or CMUCL), and enter:

  (load "runme")

Exciting, huh?
