Modules for handling abstract Erlang syntax trees, in a way that is compatible with the "parse trees" of the standard library module `erl_parse', together with utilities for reading source files in unusual ways and pretty-printing syntax trees. Note that the latest version of the syntax_tools application is nowadays part of the standard Erlang/OTP distribution. The Jungerl version is frozen.
