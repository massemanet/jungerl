To make wiki fly do the following

1) cd to the pico web server's directory (e.g. jungerl/lib/pico)
   and type "make"
   
2) cd to the wiki directory (jungerl/lib/wiki, that contains this README)
   and type "make"

3) If desired, edit bin/wiki.sh to set appropriate paths. (The script
   will work unchanged from a checked out Jungerl source tree.)

4) From the wiki directory, give the command

   bin/wiki.sh start

Browse to http://localhost:4999/ (or whatever port is set in wiki.sh)
