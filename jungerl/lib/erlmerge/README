For developers (as of 14 Apr 2005)
----------------------------------

Install it as:

make
make install  (as root if 'erl' is installed as root) 

This will create a directory and a DB:

 ..../erlmerge_DB/erlmerge.dets

The DB will be filled with info about the existing apps.
List them with the command:

 erlmerge search
 erlmerge search mnesia

Check the 'Installed' info, it should be 'true'

Now sync the DB with the latest stuff from trapexit.org:

erlmerge sync   (again as root if necessary)

This will store the sync info in:

 ..../erlmerge_DB/sync.erlmerge

List the DB again and look for 'eldap' and 'eradius'
They should not be installed.

Now, to install an application do as in this example:

 erlmerge -i esmb

or for a dryrun:

 erlmerge -p -i esmb

The '-i' (or 'install') switch will retrieve the application
and all its dependencies, unpack them and compile them
under your $(ERLANG)/lib directory. So, for example, the
application esmb may end up as a directory:

 /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/esmb-1.0/

Which will make it available when you start your
Erlang node/shell.
