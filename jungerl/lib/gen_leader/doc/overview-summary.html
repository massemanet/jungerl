<h1>The gen_leader application</h1>
<p><b>Version:</b> 1.0
</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ulf Wiger (<a href="mailto:ulf.wiger@ericsson.com"><tt>ulf.wiger@ericsson.com</tt></a>), Thomas Arts (<a href="mailto:thomas.arts@ituniv.se"><tt>thomas.arts@ituniv.se</tt></a>).</p>
A leader election behaviour modeled after gen_server.
<p>This behaviour intends to make it reasonably
straightforward to implement a fully distributed and fault-tolerant
server with master-slave semantics.</p>

<p>The leader election algorithm used is designed to find a leader
in constant time. A prerequisite is that all candidates are known
from the beginning (but obviously, they do not all need to be alive.)</p>

<p>The gen_leader behaviour supports nearly everything that gen_server
does (some functions, such as multicall() and the internal timeout,
have been removed), and adds a few callbacks and API functions to 
support leader election etc.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Included is an example program, a global dictionary,
<a href="gdict.html">gdict</a>, based on the modules gen_leader and dict.
The callback implementing the global dictionary is called
'test_cb', for no particularly logical reason.</p>

<h3>gdict</h3>

<p><a href="gdict.html">gdict</a> consists of 50 lines of code, essentially
emulating the interface of <code>dict.erl</code>. The "magic" in
gdict is performed by two macros:
<pre>
-define(store(Dict,Expr,Legend),
        gen_leader:leader_call(Dict, {store, fun(D) ->
                                                     Expr
                                             end})).

-define(lookup(Dict, Expr, Legend),
        gen_leader:call(Dict, {lookup, fun(D) ->
                                               Expr
                                       end})).
</pre></p>

<p>(<code>Legend</code> was a means to hook in some debugging info,
but is currently not used.)</p>

<p>Using these macros, the update functions in <code>dict.erl</code>
can be mapped to a set of gen_leader processes maintaining a
replicated dictionary:</p>

<pre>
store(Key, Value, Dict) ->
    ?store(Dict, dict:store(Key,Value,D), store).

fetch(Key, Dict) -> ?lookup(Dict, dict:fetch(Key,D), fetch).
</pre>

<p>... and so on.</p>

<p>Instantiating a global dictionary is done via
<code>gdict:new/3</code>:</p>

<pre>
new(Name, Candidates, Workers) ->
    gen_leader:start(Name,Candidates, Workers, test_cb, dict:new(), []).
</pre>

<h3>test_cb</h3>

<p><a href="test_cb.html">test_cb</a> consists of 49 lines of code, and is the
<code>gen_leader</code> callback module supporting gdict. The "magic"
is performed by the following lines:</p>
<pre>
handle_leader_call({store,F}, From, Dict, E) ->
    NewDict = F(Dict),
    {reply, ok, {store, F}, NewDict};
...
from_leader({store,F}, Dict, E) ->
    NewDict = F(Dict),
    {ok, NewDict}.

handle_call({lookup, F}, From, Dict) ->
    Reply = F(Dict),
    {reply, Reply, Dict}.
</pre>

<p>Note that updates are served through the leader, using
<code>gen_leader:leader_call/2</code> and
<code>handle_leader_call/4</code> respectively, while lookups
are served locally, using <code>gen_leader:call/2</code> and
<code>handle_call/3</code>. More details are found in <a href="test_cb.html">test_cb</a>.</p>


<h2>Callbacks</h2>

<p>Documentation of the required callbacks can be found in the
example callback <a href="test_cb.html" target="overviewFrame">test_cb</a>.</p>
