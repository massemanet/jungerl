Epop - The Erlang POP3 client/server package

Epop integrates a number of things into one neat package,
which is easily configured to include several users with
multiple remote POP3 maildrops as well as a local maildrop.
Still it is of course possible to use the various parts
independently. For example you may want to only use the Epop
client part in your particular Erlang application. One
reason to use Epop could be the fact that Epop doesn't suffer
of any security breaches caused by over running memory since
no memory is explicitly allocated (its all taken care of
by the underlying Erlang machinery).

Epop supports the APOP authentication scheme as described 
in RFC-1939. It also implements an extension to POP3, supporting 
notification of changes to a specified maildrop. Epop has been 
tested to work with Qpopper, Fetchmail, VM, nmh (mh-e) and 
ESMTP Sendmail 8.8.5/8.8.5. Here is a summary of the features
of Epop:

 + A POP3 server.
 + A POP3 client.
 + A SMTP client
 + A local mail delivery agent..
 + A multi user mail storage backend.
 + Log support.
 + Xbiff like, per user, mail notifier.
 + A mail reader.
 + Easy to configure.
