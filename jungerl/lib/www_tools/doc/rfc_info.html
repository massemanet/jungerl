0. Abstract<br>
<p>
   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the<br>
   syntax and semantics of formalized information for location and<br>
   access of resources on the Internet.<br>
<p>
1. Introduction<br>
<p>
   The work is derived from concepts introduced by the World-Wide Web<br>
   global information initiative,  whose use of  such objects dates<br>
   from 1990 and is described in "Universal Resource Identifiers in<br>
   WWW", RFC 1630.<br>
<p>
   This document was written by the URI working group of the Internet<br>
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments may be addressed to the editor,<br>
   Tim Berners-Lee &lt;timbl@info.cern.ch&gt;, or to the URI-WG<br>
   &lt;uri@bunyip.com&gt;. Discussions of the group are archived at<br>
   &lt;URL:<a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URI/archive/uri-archive.index.html">http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URI/archive/uri-archive.index.html</a>&gt;<br>
<p>
2. Recommendations<br>
<p>
   This document describes the syntax for "Uniform Resource Locators"<br>
   (URLs): a compact representation of the location and access method<br>
   for a resource available on the Internet. Just as there are many<br>
   different methods of access to resources, there are several<br>
   _schemes_ for describing the location of such resources.<br>
<p>
   The generic syntax provides a framework for new URL schemes to be<br>
   resolved using as yet undefined protocols.<br>
<p>
   The syntax is described in two parts. First, we give the syntax<br>
   rules of a completely specified URL; second, we give the rules<br>
   under which parts of the URL may be omitted in a well-defined<br>
   context.<br>
<p>
2.1. URL SYNTAX<br>
<p>
   URLs are written as follows:<br>
<p>
       &lt;scheme&gt;:&lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;<br>
<p>
   A the URL contains the name of the scheme being used (&lt;scheme&gt;)<br>
   followed by a colon and then a string (the &lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;)<br>
   whose interpretation depends on the scheme.<br>
<p>
   Scheme names consist of lower case letters "a"--"z", digits, and<br>
   the characters plus ("+"), period ("."), and hyphen ("-"). For<br>
   resiliency, programs interpreting URLs should allow upper case<br>
   letters as equivalent to lower case in scheme names (e.g., allow<br>
   "HTTP" as well as "http").<br>
<p>
   A BNF description of the URL syntax is given in Section 5.<br>
<p>
2.2. Reserved, unsafe, and encoded characters<br>
<p>
   URLs are represented as a sequence of characters.  Characters are<br>
   used to represent the 8-bit byte that corresponds to their ASCII<br>
   encoding.<br>
 <br>
   There is a standard way, known as `URL-encoding', to encode bytes<br>
   that are otherwise disallowed: bytes are encoded by representing<br>
   them as a percent sign "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits (0-9,<br>
   A-F).<br>
<p>
   In any circumstance, only printable ASCII characters are allowed:<br>
   URLs may not contain space or other non-printable characters. These<br>
   and the character "%" must always be encoded.<br>
   <br>
   Many URL schemes reserve certain characters for a special meaning;<br>
   their appearance in the scheme-specific part of the URL has a<br>
   designated semantics. If it is necessary to designate a byte in a<br>
   component of a URL that would otherwise be represented by a<br>
   reserved character, it is necessary to represent that byte encoded.<br>
   The characters ";", "/", "?", ":", "@", "=" and "&amp;" are the<br>
   characters which may be reserved for special meaning within a<br>
   scheme.  No other characters may be reserved within a scheme.<br>
<p>
   Most characters mean the same thing when represented as themselves<br>
   as when represented encoded; however, this is not true for reserved<br>
   characters: encoding a reserved character for a particular scheme<br>
   may change the semantics of a URL.<br>
<p>
   There are a number of characters whose use in URLs is _unsafe_;<br>
   characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons.  The characters<br>
   "&lt;" and "&gt;" are unsafe because they are used as the delimiters<br>
   around URLs in free text; the quote mark (""") is used to delimit<br>
   URLs in other systems. The character "#" is unsafe because it is<br>
   used in World Wide Web and in other systems to delimit a URL from a<br>
   fragment identifier that might follow it.  Other characters are<br>
   unsafe because gateways and other transport agents are sometimes<br>
   known to modify such characters. All unsafe characters should<br>
   always be encoded within a URL. For example, the character "#"<br>
   should always be encoded within URLs, even in systems that do not<br>
   normally deal with fragment identifiers, so that if the URL is<br>
   copied into another system that does use fragments it will not be<br>
   necessary to change the URL encoding.<br>
    <br>
   In general, only alphanumerics, reserved characters used for their<br>
   reserved purposes, "$", "-", "_", ".", and "+" are safe and may be<br>
   transmitted unencoded. Even so, safe characters _may_ be encoded<br>
   within the scheme specific part of a URL.<br>
<p>
3. Specific Schemes<br>
<p>
   The mapping for some existing standard and experimental protocols<br>
   is outlined in the BNF syntax definition.  Notes on particular<br>
   protocols follow. The schemes covered are:<br>
<p>
   ftp                     File Transfer protocol<br>
   http                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol<br>
   gopher                  The Gopher protocol<br>
   mailto                  Electronic mail address<br>
   news                    USENET news<br>
   nntp                    USENET news using NNTP access<br>
   telnet                  Reference to interactive sessions<br>
   wais                    Wide Area Information Servers<br>
   file                    Host-specific file names<br>
   prospero                Prospero Directory Service<br>
<p>
   Other schemes may be specified by future specifications. Section 4<br>
   of this document describes how new schemes may be registered, and<br>
   lists some scheme names that are under development.<br>
<p>
3.1. Common Internet Scheme Syntax<br>
<p>
   While the syntax for the rest of the URL may vary depending on the<br>
   particular scheme selected, URL schemes that involve the direct use<br>
   of an IP-based protocol to a specified host on the Internet use a<br>
   common syntax for the initial part of the scheme-specific data:<br>
<p>
        //&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;<br>
        //&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;url-path&gt;<br>
<p>
   This initial part starts with a double slash "//" to indicate its<br>
   presence, and continues until the following slash "/", if any.<br>
   Within this section are:<br>
<p>
    user<br>
        An optional user name. Some schemes (e.g., ftp) allow the<br>
        specification of a user name.<br>
<p>
    password<br>
        An optional password. If present, it follows the user<br>
        name separated from it by a colon.<br>
<p>
   The user name (and password), if present, are followed by a<br>
   commercial at-sign "@". Within the user and password field, any<br>
   ":", "@", or "/" must be encoded.<br>
<p>
   Note that an empty user name or password is different than no user<br>
   name or password; there is no way to specify a password without<br>
   specifying a user name. E.g., &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://@host.com/">ftp://@host.com/</a>&gt; has an empty<br>
   user name and no password, &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://host.com/">ftp://host.com/</a>&gt; has no user name,<br>
   while &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://foo:@host.com/">ftp://foo:@host.com/</a>&gt; has a user name of "foo" and an<br>
   empty password.<br>
<p>
    host<br>
        The fully qualified domain name of a network host, or its IP<br>
        address as a set of four decimal digits separated by periods. <br>
        Fully qualified domain names take the form as described in<br>
        Section 3.5 of RFC 1034: a sequence of parts separated by<br>
        period.<br>
<p>
    port<br>
        The (optional) port number to connect to. Most schemes<br>
        designate protocols that have a default port number. Another<br>
        port number may optionally be supplied, in decimal, separated<br>
        from the host by a colon.<br>
<p>
    url-path<br>
        The rest of the locator consists of data specific to the<br>
        scheme, and is known as the "url-path". It supplies the<br>
        details of how the specified resource can be accessed. Note<br>
        that the "/" between the host (or port) and the url-path is<br>
        NOT part of the url-path.<br>
<p>
   The url-path is interpreted in a manner dependent on the scheme<br>
   being used.<br>
<p>
3.2. FTP<br>
<p>
   The FTP URL scheme is used to designate files and directories on<br>
   Internet hosts accessible using the FTP protocol (RFC959).<br>
<p>
   A FTP URL follow the syntax described in Section 3.1.  If :&lt;port&gt;<br>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 21.<br>
<p>
3.2.1. FTP Name and Password<br>
<p>
   A user name and password may be supplied. If no user name or<br>
   password is supplied and one is requested by the FTP server, the<br>
   conventions for "anonymous" FTP are to be used, as follows:<br>
<p>
        The user name "anonymous" is supplied.<br>
<p>
        The password is supplied as the Internet e-mail address<br>
        of the end user accessing the resource.<br>
<p>
   If the URL supplies a user name but no password, and the remote<br>
   server requests a password, the program interpreting the FTP URL<br>
   should request one from the user.<br>
<p>
3.2.2. FTP url-path<br>
<p>
   The url-path of a FTP URL has the following syntax:<br>
<p>
        &lt;cwd1&gt;/&lt;cwd2&gt;/.../&lt;cwdN&gt;/&lt;name&gt;;type=&lt;typecode&gt;<br>
<p>
   Where &lt;cwd1&gt; through &lt;cwdN&gt; and &lt;name&gt; are (possibly encoded)<br>
   strings and &lt;typecode&gt; is one of the characters "a", "i", or "d".<br>
<p>
   The url-path is interpreted as a series of FTP commands as follows:<br>
<p>
      Each of the &lt;cwd&gt; elements is to be supplied, sequentially, as<br>
      the argument to a CWD (change working directory) command.<br>
<p>
      If the typecode is "d", perform a NLST (name list) command with<br>
      &lt;name&gt; as the argument, and interpret the results as a file<br>
      directory listing.<br>
<p>
      Otherwise, perform a TYPE command with &lt;typecode&gt; as the<br>
      argument, and then access the file whose name is &lt;name&gt; (for<br>
      example, using the RETR command.)<br>
<p>
   Within a name or CWD component, the characters "/" and ";" are<br>
   reserved and must be encoded. The components are decoded prior to<br>
   their use in the FTP protocol.  In particular, if the appropriate<br>
   FTP sequence to access a particular file requires supplying a<br>
   string containing a "/" as an argument to a CWD or RETR command, it<br>
   is necessary to encode each "/" as %2F.<br>
<p>
   For example, the URL &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://myname@host.dom/%2Fetc/motd">ftp://myname@host.dom/%2Fetc/motd</a>&gt; is<br>
   interpreted by FTP-ing to "host.dom", logging in as "myname"<br>
   (prompting for a password if it is asked for), and then executing<br>
   "CWD /etc" and then "RETR motd". This has a different meaning from<br>
   &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://myname@host.dom/etc/motd">ftp://myname@host.dom/etc/motd</a>&gt; which would "CWD etc",<br>
   relative to the default directory for "myname", or &lt;URL:ftp:<br>
   //myname@host.dom//etc/motd&gt;, which would "CWD " with a null<br>
   argument and then "RETR motd".<br>
<p>
3.2.3. FTP Typecode is Optional<br>
<p>
   The entire ;type=&lt;typecode&gt; part of a FTP URL is optional. If it is<br>
   omitted, the client program interpreting the URL must guess the<br>
   appropriate mode to use. In general, the data content type of a<br>
   file can only be guessed from the name, e.g., from the suffix of<br>
   the name; the appropriate type code to be used for transfer of the<br>
   file can then be deduced from the data content of the file.<br>
<p>
3.2.4 Hierarchy<br>
<p>
   For some file systems, the "/" used to denote the hierarchical<br>
   structure of the URL corresponds to the delimiter used to construct<br>
   a file name hierarchy, and thus, the filename will look similar to<br>
   the URL path. This does NOT mean that the URL is a Unix filename.<br>
<p>
3.2.5. Optimization<br>
<p>
   Clients accessing resources via FTP may employ additional<br>
   heuristics to optimize the interaction. For some FTP servers, for<br>
   example, it may be reasonable to keep the control connection open<br>
   while accessing multiple URLs from the same server. However, there<br>
   is no common hierarchical model to the FTP protocol, so if a<br>
   directory change command has been given, it is impossible in<br>
   general to deduce what sequence should be given to navigate to<br>
   another directory for a second retrieval, if the paths are<br>
   different.  The only reliable algorithm is to disconnect and<br>
   reestablish the control connection.<br>
<p>
3.3. HTTP<br>
<p>
   The HTTP URL scheme is used to designate Internet resources<br>
   accessible using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).<br>
<p>
   The HTTP protocol is specified elsewhere. This specification only<br>
   describes the syntax of HTTP URLs. <br>
<p>
   An HTTP URL takes the form:<br>
<p>
      <a href="http://">http://</a>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;searchpart&gt;<br>
<p>
   where &lt;host&gt; and &lt;port&gt; are as described in Section 3.1. If :&lt;port&gt;<br>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 80.  No user name or password is<br>
   allowed.  &lt;path&gt; is an HTTP selector, and &lt;searchpart&gt; is a query<br>
   string. The &lt;path&gt; is optional, as is the &lt;searchpart&gt; and its<br>
   preceding "?". If neither &lt;path&gt; nor &lt;searchpart&gt; is present, the<br>
   "/" may also be omitted.<br>
<p>
   Within the &lt;path&gt; and &lt;searchpart&gt; components, "/", ";", "?" are<br>
   reserved.  The "/" character may be used within HTTP to designate a<br>
   hierarchical structure.<br>
<p>
3.4. GOPHER<br>
<p>
   The Gopher URL scheme is used to designate Internet resources<br>
   accessible using the Gopher protocol.<br>
<p>
   The base Gopher protocol is specified in RFC 1436 and supports<br>
   items and collections of items (directories). The Gopher+ protocol<br>
   is a set of upward compatible extensions to the base Gopher<br>
   protocol and is specified in [2]. Gopher+ supports associating<br>
   arbitrary sets of attributes and alternate data representations<br>
   with Gopher items. Gopher URLs accommodate both Gopher and Gopher+<br>
   items and item attributes.<br>
<p>
3.4.1. Gopher URL syntax<br>
<p>
   A Gopher URL takes the form: <br>
<p>
      <a href="gopher://">gopher://</a>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;gopher-path&gt;<br>
<p>
   where &lt;gopher-path&gt; is one of<br>
<p>
       &lt;gophertype&gt;&lt;selector&gt;<br>
       &lt;gophertype&gt;&lt;selector&gt;%09&lt;search&gt;<br>
       &lt;gophertype&gt;&lt;selector&gt;%09&lt;gopher+_string&gt;<br>
       &lt;gophertype&gt;&lt;selector&gt;%09&lt;search&gt;%09&lt;gopher+_string&gt;<br>
<p>
   If :&lt;port&gt; is omitted, the port defaults to 70.  &lt;gophertype&gt; is<br>
   single-character field to denote the Gopher type of the resource to<br>
   which the URL refers. The entire &lt;gopher-path&gt; may also be empty,<br>
   in which case the delimiting "/" is also optional and the<br>
   &lt;gophertype&gt; defaults to "1".<br>
<p>
   &lt;selector&gt; is the Gopher selector string.  In the Gopher protocol,<br>
   gopher selector strings are a sequence of 8-bit bytes which may<br>
   contain any characters other than tab, return, or linefeed.  Gopher<br>
   clients specify which item to retrieve by sending the gopher<br>
   selector string to a gopher server.<br>
   <br>
   Within the &lt;gopher-path&gt;, no additional characters have a reserved<br>
   interpretation.<br>
<p>
   Note that some gopher &lt;selector&gt; strings begin with a copy of the<br>
   &lt;gophertype&gt; character, in which case that character will occur<br>
   twice consecutively. The gopher selector string may be an empty<br>
   string; this is how gopher clients refer to the top-level directory<br>
   on a gopher server.<br>
<p>
3.4.2 Specifying URLs for Gopher Search Engines<br>
<p>
   If the URL refers to a search to be submitted to a gopher search<br>
   engine, the selector is followed by an encoded tab (%09) and the<br>
   search string. To submit a search to a gopher search engine, the<br>
   gopher client sends the selector string, a tab, and the search<br>
   string to the gopher server.<br>
<p>
3.4.3 URL syntax for Gopher+ items<br>
<p>
   URLs for Gopher+ items are have a second encoded tab and a<br>
   gopher+ string. Note that in this case, the %09&lt;search&gt; string must<br>
   be supplied, although the &lt;search&gt; element may be the empty string.<br>
<p>
   The &lt;gopher+_string&gt; is used to represent information required for<br>
   retrieval of the Gopher+ item. Gopher+ items may have alternate<br>
   views, arbitrary sets of attributes, and may have electronic forms<br>
   associated with them.<br>
<p>
   To retrieve the data associated with a Gopher+ URL, a client will<br>
   connect to the server and send the gopher selector, followed<br>
   optionally by a tab and the search string, followed by a tab and<br>
   the Gopher+ commands.<br>
<p>
   More explicitly, if the Gopher+ URL refers to a Gopher search type<br>
   (that is, if the Gopher type is 7), the client sends to the gopher<br>
   server the gopher selector string, followed by a tab, followed the<br>
   search string, followed by a tab, followed by the gopher+ commands.<br>
<p>
   If the Gopher+ URL does _not_ refer to a Gopher search (when the<br>
   Gopher type is not 7), the Gopher client sends to the server the<br>
   gopher selector string, followed by a tab, followed by the gopher+<br>
   commands.<br>
<p>
3.4.4 Default Gopher+ data representation<br>
<p>
   When a Gopher server returns a directory listing to a client, the<br>
   Gopher+ items are tagged with either a "+" (denoting gopher+ items)<br>
   or a "?" (denoting Gopher+ items which have a +ASK form associated <br>
   with them). A Gopher URL with a Gopher+ string consisting of only <br>
   a "+" refers to the default view (data representation) of the item <br>
   while a Gopher+ string containing only a "?" refer to an item with<br>
   a Gopher electronic form associated with it.<br>
<p>
3.4.5 Gopher+ items with electronic forms<br>
<p>
   Gopher+ items which have a +ASK associated with them (i.e. Gopher+<br>
   items tagged with a "?") require the client to fetch the item's<br>
   +ASK attribute to get the form definition, and then ask the user to<br>
   fill out the form and return the user's responses along with the<br>
   selector string to retrieve the item.  Gopher+ clients know how to<br>
   do this but depend on the "?" tag in the gopher+ item description<br>
   to know when to handle this case. The "?" is used in the Gopher+<br>
   string to be consistent with Gopher+ protocol's use of this symbol.<br>
<p>
3.4.6 Gopher+ item attribute collections<br>
<p>
   To refer to the Gopher+ attributes of an item, the Gopher URL's <br>
   Gopher+ string consists of "!" or "$". "!" refers to the all of a <br>
   Gopher+ item's attributes. "$" refers to all the item attributes for<br>
   all items in a Gopher directory.<br>
<p>
3.4.7 Referring to specific Gopher+ attributes<br>
<p>
   To refer to specific attributes, the URL's gopher+_string is<br>
   "!attribute_name" or "$attribute_name". For example, to refer to<br>
   the attribute containing the abstract of an item, the <br>
   gopher+_string would be "!+ABSTRACT". <br>
<p>
   To refer to several attributes, the gopher+_string consists of <br>
   the attribute names separated by coded spaces. For example, <br>
   "!+ABSTRACT%20+SMELL" refers to the +ABSTRACT and +SMELL attributes <br>
   of an item.<br>
<p>
3.4.8 URL syntax for Gopher+ alternate views<br>
<p>
   Gopher+ allows for optional alternate data representations<br>
   (alternate views) of items. To retrieve a Gopher+ alternate view,<br>
   a Gopher+ client sends the appropriate view and language<br>
   identifier (found in the item's +VIEW attribute). To refer to a<br>
   specific Gopher+ alternate view, the URL's Gopher+ string would <br>
   be in the form:<br>
<p>
        +view_name%20language_name<br>
<p>
   For example, a Gopher+ string of "+application/postscript%20Es_ES" <br>
   refers to the Spanish language postscript alternate view of a <br>
   Gopher+ item. <br>
<p>
3.4.9 URL syntax for Gopher+ electronic forms<br>
<p>
   The gopher+ string for a URL that refers to an item referenced by<br>
   a Gopher+ electronic form (an ASK block) filled out with specific <br>
   values is a coded version of what the client sends to the server.<br>
   The gopher+ string is of the form:<br>
<p>
   +%091%0D%0A+-1%0D%0Aask_item1_value%0D%0Aask_item2_value%0D%0A.%0D%0A<br>
<p>
   To retrieve this item, the gopher client sends:<br>
<p>
       a_gopher_selector&lt;tab&gt;+&lt;tab&gt;1&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;<br>
       +-1&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;<br>
       ask_item1_value&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;<br>
       ask_item2_value&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;<br>
       .&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;<br>
<p>
   to the gopher server.<br>
<p>
3.5. MAILTO<br>
<p>
   The mailto URL scheme is used to designate the Internet mailing<br>
   address of an individual or service. No additional information<br>
   other than an Internet mailing address is present or implied.<br>
<p>
   A mailto URL takes the form:<br>
<p>
        <a href="mailto:">mailto:</a>&lt;rfc822-addr-spec&gt;<br>
<p>
   where &lt;rfc822-addr-spec&gt; is (the encoding of an) addr-spec, as<br>
   specified in RFC 822. Within mailto URLs, no additional characters<br>
   are reserved within the &lt;rfc822-addr-spec&gt; component.<br>
<p>
   Note that the percent sign ("%") is commonly used within RFC 822<br>
   addresses and must be URL-encoded.<br>
<p>
   Unlike many URLs, the mailto scheme does not represent a data<br>
   object to be accessed directly; there is no sense in which it<br>
   designates an object. It has a different use than the<br>
   message/external-body type in MIME.<br>
<p>
3.6. NEWS<br>
<p>
   The news URL scheme is used to refer to either news groups or<br>
   individual articles of USENET news, as specified in RFC 1036.<br>
<p>
   A news URL takes one of two forms:<br>
<p>
     <a href="news:">news:</a>&lt;newsgroup-name&gt;<br>
     <a href="news:">news:</a>&lt;message-id&gt;<br>
<p>
   A &lt;newsgroup-name&gt; is a period-delimited hierarchical name, such as<br>
   "comp.infosystems.www.misc". A &lt;message-id&gt; corresponds to the<br>
   Message-ID of section 2.1.5 of RFC 1036, without the enclosing "&lt;"<br>
   and "&gt;"; it takes the form &lt;unique&gt;@&lt;full_domain_name&gt;.  A message<br>
   identifier may be distinguished from a news group name by the<br>
   presence of the commercial at "@" character. No additional<br>
   characters are reserved within the components of a news URL.<br>
<p>
   If &lt;newsgroup-name&gt; is "*" (as in &lt;URL:<a href="news:">news:</a>*&gt;), it is used to<br>
   refer to "all available news groups".<br>
<p>
   The news URLs are unusual in that by themselves, they do not<br>
   contain sufficient information to locate a single resource, but,<br>
   rather, are location-independent.<br>
<p>
3.7. NNTP<br>
<p>
   The nntp URL scheme is an alternative method of referencing news<br>
   articles, useful for specifying news articles from NNTP servers<br>
   (RFC 977). <br>
<p>
   A nntp URL take the form:<br>
<p>
      nntp://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;newsgroup-name&gt;/&lt;article-number&gt;<br>
<p>
   where &lt;host&gt; and &lt;port&gt; are as described in Section 3.1. If :&lt;port&gt;<br>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 119.<br>
<p>
   The &lt;newsgroup-name&gt; is the name of the group, while the<br>
   &lt;article-number&gt; is the numeric id of the article within that<br>
   newsgroup.<br>
<p>
   Note that while nntp: URLs specify a unique location for the<br>
   article resource, most NNTP servers currently on the Internet today<br>
   are configured only to allow access from local clients, and thus<br>
   nntp URLs do not designate globally accessible resources. Thus, the<br>
   <a href="news:">news:</a> form of URL is preferred as a way of identifying news<br>
   articles.<br>
<p>
3.8. TELNET<br>
<p>
   The Telnet URL scheme is used to designate interactive services<br>
   that may be accessed by the Telnet protocol.<br>
<p>
   A telnet URL takes the form:<br>
<p>
       telnet://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; [ / ]<br>
<p>
   as specified in Section 3.1. The port defaults to 23; the &lt;user&gt;<br>
   and &lt;password&gt; segments are completely optional (a &lt;password&gt;<br>
   requires a &lt;user&gt; element.)<br>
<p>
   This URL does not designate a data object, but rather an<br>
   interactive service. In practice, the &lt;user&gt; and &lt;password&gt;<br>
   supplied are advisory only.<br>
<p>
3.9.  WAIS<br>
<p>
   The WAIS URL scheme is used to designate WAIS databases, searches,<br>
   or individual documents available from a WAIS database. WAIS is<br>
   described in [6]; the WAIS protocol is described in RFC 1625 [19].<br>
<p>
   A WAIS URLs takes one the following forms:<br>
<p>
     <a href="wais://">wais://</a>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;<br>
     <a href="wais://">wais://</a>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;?&lt;search&gt;<br>
     <a href="wais://">wais://</a>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;/&lt;wtype&gt;/&lt;wpath&gt;<br>
<p>
   where &lt;host&gt; and &lt;port&gt; are as described in Section 3.1. If :&lt;port&gt;<br>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 210.  The first form designates a<br>
   WAIS database that is available for searching. The second form<br>
   designates a particular search.  &lt;database&gt; is the name of the WAIS<br>
   database being queried.<br>
<p>
   The third form designates a particular document within a WAIS<br>
   database to be retrieved. In this form &lt;wtype&gt; is the WAIS<br>
   designation of the type of the object. Many WAIS implementations<br>
   require that a client know the "type" of an object prior to<br>
   retrieval, the type being returned along with the internal object<br>
   identifier in the search response.  The &lt;wtype&gt; is included in the<br>
   URL in order to allow the client interpreting the URL adequate<br>
   information to actually retrieve the document.<br>
<p>
   The &lt;wpath&gt; of a WAIS URL consists of the WAIS document-id, encoded<br>
   as necessary using the method described in Section 2.2. The WAIS<br>
   document-id should be treated opaquely; it may only be decomposed<br>
   by the server that issued it.<br>
<p>
3.10 FILES<br>
<p>
   The file URL scheme is used to designate files accessible on<br>
   a particular host computer. This scheme, unlike most other <br>
   URL schemes, does not designate a resource that is universally<br>
   accessible over the Internet.<br>
<p>
   A file URL takes the form:<br>
<p>
       <a href="file://">file://</a>&lt;host&gt;/&lt;path&gt;<br>
<p>
   where &lt;host&gt; is the fully qualified domain name of the system on<br>
   which the &lt;path&gt; is accessible, and &lt;path&gt; is a hierarchical<br>
   directory path of the form &lt;directory&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.<br>
<p>
   For example, a VMS file<br>
<p>
     DISK$USER:[MY.NOTES]NOTE123456.TXT<br>
<p>
   might become<br>
<p>
     &lt;URL:<a href="file://vms.host.edu/disk$user/my/notes/note12345.txt">file://vms.host.edu/disk$user/my/notes/note12345.txt</a>&gt;<br>
<p>
   As a special case, &lt;host&gt; can be the string "localhost" or the<br>
   empty string; this is interpreted as `the machine from which the<br>
   URL is being interpreted'.<br>
<p>
   The file URL scheme is unusual in that it does not specify an<br>
   Internet protocol or access method for such files; as such, its<br>
   utility in network protocols between hosts is limited.<br>
<p>
3.11 PROSPERO<br>
<p>
   The Prospero URL scheme is used to designate resources that are<br>
   accessed via the Prospero Directory Service. The Prospero protocol<br>
   is described elsewhere [16].<br>
<p>
   A prospero URLs takes the form:<br>
<p>
      prospero://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;hsoname&gt;;&lt;field&gt;=&lt;value&gt;<br>
<p>
   where &lt;host&gt; and &lt;port&gt; are as described in Section 3.1. If :&lt;port&gt;<br>
   is omitted, the port defaults to 1525. No username or password is<br>
   allowed.<br>
<p>
   The &lt;hsoname&gt; is the host-specific object name in the Prospero<br>
   protocol, suitably encoded.  This name is opaque and interpreted by<br>
   the Prospero server.  The semicolon ";" is reserved and may not<br>
   appear without quoting in the &lt;hsoname&gt;.<br>
<p>
   Prospero URLs are interpreted by contacting a Prospero directory<br>
   server on the specified host and port to determine appropriate<br>
   access methods for a resource, which might themselves be<br>
   represented as different URLs. External Prospero links are<br>
   represented as URLs of the underlying access method and are not<br>
   represented as Prospero URLs.<br>
<p>
   Note that a slash "/" may appear in the &lt;hsoname&gt; without quoting<br>
   and no significance may be assumed by the application.  Though<br>
   slashes may indicate hierarchical structure on the server, such<br>
   structure is not guaranteed. Note that many &lt;hsoname&gt;s begin with a<br>
   slash, in which case the host or port will be followed by a double<br>
   slash: the slash from the URL syntax, followed by the initial slash<br>
   from the &lt;hsoname&gt;. (E.g., &lt;URL:prospero://host.dom//pros/name&gt;<br>
   designates a &lt;hsoname&gt; of "/pros/name".)<br>
<p>
   In addition, after the &lt;hsoname&gt;, optional fields and values<br>
   associated with a Prospero link may be specified as part of the<br>
   URL.  When present, each field/value pair is separated from each<br>
   other and from the rest of the URL by a ";" (semicolon).  The name<br>
   of the field and its value are separated by a "=" (equal sign). If<br>
   present, these fields serve to identify the target of the URL.  For<br>
   example, the OBJECT-VERSION field can be specified to identify a<br>
   specific version of an object.<br>
<p>
4. REGISTRATION OF NEW SCHEMES<br>
<p>
   A new scheme may be introduced by defining a mapping onto a<br>
   conforming URL syntax, using a new prefix. Experimental prefixes<br>
   may be used by mutual agreement between parties. Scheme names<br>
   starting with the characters "x-" are reserved for experimental<br>
   purposes.<br>
<p>
   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) will maintain a<br>
   registry of URL schemes. Any submission of a new URL scheme must<br>
   include a definition of an algorithm for accessing of resources<br>
   within that scheme and the syntax for representing such a scheme.<br>
<p>
   URL schemes must have demonstrable utility and operability.  One<br>
   way to provide such a demonstration is via a gateway which provides<br>
   objects in the new scheme for clients using an existing protocol.<br>
   If the new scheme does not locate resources that are data objects,<br>
   the properties of names in the new space must be clearly defined.<br>
<p>
   New schemes should try to follow the same syntactic conventions of<br>
   existing schemes, where appropriate.  It is likewise recommended<br>
   that, where a protocol allows for retrieval by URL, that the client<br>
   software have provision for being configured to use specific<br>
   gateway locators for indirect access through new naming schemes.<br>
<p>
   The following scheme have been proposed at various times, but this<br>
   document does not define their syntax or use at this time. It is<br>
   suggested that IANA reserve their scheme names for future<br>
   definition:<br>
<p>
   afs	            Andrew File System global file names.<br>
   mid              Message identifiers for electronic mail.<br>
   cid              Content identifiers for MIME body parts.<br>
   nfs              Network File System (NFS) file names.<br>
   tn3270           Interactive 3270 emulation sessions.<br>
   mailserver       Access to data available from mail servers.<br>
   z39.50           Access to ANSI Z39.50 services.<br>
<p>
5. BNF for specific URL schemes<br>
<p>
   This is a BNF-like description of the Uniform Resource Locator<br>
   syntax, using the conventions of RFC822, except that "|" is used to<br>
   designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used around optional or<br>
   repeated elements. Briefly, literals are quoted with "", optional<br>
   elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements may be preceded<br>
   with &lt;n&gt;* to designate n or more repetitions of the following<br>
   element; n defaults to 0.<br>

6. Security considerations<br>
<p>
   The URL scheme does not in itself pose a security threat. Users<br>
   should beware that there is no general guarantee that a URL which<br>
   at one time points to a given object continues to do so, and does<br>
   not even at some later time point to a different object due to the<br>
   movement of objects on servers.<br>
<p>
   A URL-related security threat is that it is sometimes possible to<br>
   construct a URL such that an attempt to perform a harmless<br>
   idempotent operation such as the retrieval of the object will in<br>
   fact cause a possibly damaging remote operation to occur.  The<br>
   unsafe URL is typically constructed by specifying a port number<br>
   other than that reserved for the network protocol in question.  The<br>
   client unwittingly contacts a server which is in fact running a<br>
   different protocol.  The content of the URL contains instructions<br>
   which when interpreted according to this other protocol cause an<br>
   unexpected operation. An example has been the use of gopher URLs<br>
   to cause a rude message to be sent via a SMTP server.  Caution<br>
   should be used when using any URL which specifies a port number<br>
   other than the default for the protocol, especially when it is a<br>
   number within the reserved space.<br>
<p>
   Care should be taken when URLs contain embedded encoded delimiters<br>
   for a given protocol (for example, CR and LF characters for telnet<br>
   protocols) that these are not unencoded before transmission.  This<br>
   would violate the protocol but could be used to simulate an extra<br>
   operation or parameter, again causing an unexpected and possible<br>
   harmful remote operation to be performed.<br>
<p>
   The use of URLs containing passwords that should be secret is<br>
   clearly unwise.<br>
<p>

   on 29 March 1993. The paper url3 had been generated from udi2 in<br>
   the light of discussion at the UDI BOF meeting at the Boston IETF<br>
   in July 1992. Draft url4 was Internet Draft 00. Draft url5<br>
   incorporated changes suggested by Clifford Neuman, and draft url6<br>
   (ID 01) incorporated character group changes and a few other fixes<br>
   defined by the IETF URI WG in submitting it as a proposed standard.<br>
   URL7 (Internet Draft 02) incorporated changes introduced at the<br>
   Amsterdam IETF and refined in net discussion.<br>
<p>
   The draft 03 includes changes made at Houston in Nov 93, and on the<br>
   net before Seattle March 1994.  Draft 04 responded to various<br>
   suggestions and remarks made since the Seattle March 1994 meeting,<br>
   special thanks to Dan Connolly, Ned Freed, Roy Fielding, and Guido<br>
   van Rossum for their careful readings and corrections.  Draft 05<br>
   makes a number of minor modifications suggested at or just before<br>
   the Toronto July 1994 IETF meeting. This draft incorporates<br>
   numerous revisions and edits as suggested by the active members of<br>
   the IETF URI Working Group.<br>

APPENDIX: Recommendations for URLs in Context<br>
<p>
   URIs, including URLs, are intended to be transmitted though<br>
   protocols which provide a context for their interpretation.<br>
<p>
   In some cases, it will be necessary to distinguish URLs from other<br>
   possible data structures in a syntactic structure. In this case, is<br>
   recommended that URLs be preceeded with a prefix consisting of the<br>
   characters "URL:". For example, this prefix may be used to<br>
   distinguish URLs from other kinds of URIs.<br>
<p>
   In addition, there are many occasions when URLs are included in<br>
   plain, non-marked-up text; examples include electronic mail, USENET<br>
   news messages, or printed papers. In such cases, it is convenient<br>
   to have a separate syntactic wrapper that delimits the URL and<br>
   separates it from the rest of the text. For this purpose, is<br>
   recommended that angle brackets ("&lt;" and "&gt;"), along with the<br>
   prefix "URL:", be used to delimit the boundaries of the URL.  This<br>
   wrapper does not form part of the URL and should not be used in<br>
   contexts in which delimiters are already specified.<br>
<p>
   In some cases, extra whitespace may need to be added to break long<br>
   URLs across lines. The whitespace is ignored when extracting the<br>
   URL. In the case where a fragment identifier is associated with a<br>
   URL (following a "#"), the identifier would be placed within the<br>
   brackets as well.<br>
<p>
