spread_drv
==========

This driver is for Spread, a reliable multicast library.  According to the
Spread documentation:

    "Spread is a toolkit that provides a high performance messaging service
    that is resilient to faults across external or internal networks. Spread
    functions as a unified message bus for distributed applications, and
    provides highly tuned application-level multicast and group communication
    support. Spread services range from reliable message passing to fully
    ordered messages with delivery guarantees, even in case of computer
    failures and network partitions."

See http://www.spread.org/ for source distribution for Spread, which
is a prerequisite for attempting to build this driver.

Once you've compiled and installed libtspread.so and the Spread
header files (sp.h, ...), you'll *must* follow the instructions
found in the file SpreadConfig.mk.sample.

Once everything is compiled cleanly, and you've taken care of the
prerequisites mentioned in the "UserGuide.txt" file (in this directory),
run the regression test:

     % cd CVSROOT/jungerl/lib/spread_drv/test
     % make test

You should see the message "All regression tests PASSED."

If you have problems compiling or using this driver, please email me
