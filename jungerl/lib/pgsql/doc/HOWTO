The interface is a bit lacking at the moment, but should be sufficient
for some tasks.

Here is an example:

1> {ok, Db} = pgsql:connect("template1", "localhost", "cos").
{ok,<0.31.0>}
2> pgsql:exec(Db, "SELECT * FROM example;").
{ok,{select,[[{id,"1",int4},{name,"alfa",varchar}],
             [{id,"2",int4},{name,"beta",varchar}],
             [{id,"3",int4},{name,"gamma",varchar}]]}}
3> pgsql:close(Db).
close
