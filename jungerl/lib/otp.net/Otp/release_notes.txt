Release notes
-------------

V 0.2, May 2004 / Vlad Dumitrescu
---------------------------------

This is a direct conversion from the Java code of jinterface-1.2.1.1
(from R9C-0). It should therefore be pretty stable and deserve a version number
closer to 1, but I'd like first to have it tested by more people.

I used a CloneObject class written by Amir Harel
(http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/cloneimpl_class.asp). There's no copyright notice
accompanying the code, so I contacted the author (no answer yet).

I've been using Borland's C#Builder. There are some VisualStudio files, but they
aren't current. I'll try to fix them when I get to work (where I have MS tools).

Known issues:
- OtpSelf.accept() won't work, because of some issues with member visibility in
System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient. The workaround is to always initiate connections
from the C# node. [*]
- If running the test program several times in a row, sometimes it succeeds to
connect, sometimes it doesn't. I haven't figured out if it's a real problem or a
timeout in the Erlang node (not allowing connections to be made too often).
- tracing level can now only be set in the code, because I don't know what would
be the replacement for .properties files in C#.
- I am not sure about the thread synchronization stuff in GenericQueue. It really
hits me to rediscover how gory it can be to do concurrency in anything else than
Erlang!

Have fun!
